# Simon Says Game

## How the Game Works

### Start the Game:
When you open the game, press any key to begin. This will start the game and set the level to 1.

### Sequence Display:
The game will randomly blink a button. Your task is to remember this sequence.

### User Interaction:
Click the buttons in the same order they blinked. If you click the buttons correctly, the game will advance to the next level, and the sequence will get longer.

### Game Over:
If you click a button in the wrong order, the game stops. Your high score will be displayed, and you will be prompted to press any key to restart.
